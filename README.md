this is a platformer game. it is inspired by my love for video ganes like super mario, bounce e.t.c. as a child ive aleays wondered how games like that are made. its one or the reasons why i became a programmer. to make games so others can play and enjoy it as well. the game consist of the basic objective. collect coins, avoid the onstacles and clesr each stage. the difficulty increases the higher the level you go
